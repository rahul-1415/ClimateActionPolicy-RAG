assessment ( ccra ) , begin develop city-wide strategy adapt climate risk face future . evidence-based approach mean city confidence identified action address city ’ critical climate risk . article explains step involved identifying appropriate effective adaptation strategy , preparing city prioritise climate action included climate action plan ( cap ) . identify root cause key climate risk ccra ccra indicate likely incidence severity climate risk result future climate change , consider root cause city ’ climate risk . city ’ physical hydrological character ( sometimes called ‘ natural system ’ ) , well socioeconomic system ( ‘ human system ’ ) , also contributing factor . example , impermeable surface lack vegetation often among key reason higher urban temperature local flooding , poverty unplanned population growth may behind expansion informal settlement steep , landslide-prone slope . root cause also likely include natural human factor outside city , upstream deforestation , lead greater runoff erosion , contributing flooding downstream . working expert key public private stakeholder , city map root cause – natural human system – key risk identified ccra . identify current plan policy impacting root cause . change natural human system address root cause reduce city ’ key risk known transformative adaptation strategy . stakeholder engagement critical identifying adaptation strategy scenario planning inform mitigation strategy , knowledge expert stakeholder across relevant city agency , private sector , academia non-governmental group essential element adaptation strategy process . step also offer way meaningfully engaging stakeholder group climate action planning , helping visualise climate change likely impact city , sector , business life identify opportunity associated adaptation strategy . help secure vital support adoption implementation . city typically use workshop , series workshop , facilitate engagement . adaptation strategy identification process usually delivered city government – often cap team , though separate , connected coordinating team – though external consultant helpful supporting activity . determine city ’ adaptation goal level ambition action key climate risk adaptation goal adaptation equivalent city-wide greenhouse gas emission reduction target . building vision city ’ future , usually established start climate action planning process , informed ccra , identify adaptation goal key climate risk city face . unlike mitigation target , adaptation goal usually qualitative , using term like ‘ safer ’ , ‘ better ’ ‘ cooler ’ ( quantitative adaptation target usually action-specific , therefore , decided later climate action planning process , action prioritisation ) . adaptation goal revisited later year new insight technology become available , informed monitoring cap implementation . possible , focus value creation well risk reduction , capitalising social , economic environmental opportunity ( also known co-benefits ) associated action reduce climate risk . focusing value-creating opportunity particularly useful city dealing significant uncertainty climate risk face . help develop positive vision resonates resident , business stakeholder build support adaptation across city department . two good example include : cape town ’ water strategy , published 2020 , city ’ high-level strategy increase resilience current predicted climate risk . city ’ greatest climate risk drought , strategy learns major three-year drought – worst record – saw cape town ’ water come close running march 2018. strategy make five commitment ( goal ) view achieving vision becoming water-sensitive city : ( 1 ) safe access water sanitation , ( 2 ) wise use water , ( 3 ) sufficient reliable water diverse source , ( 4 ) shared benefit regional water resource , ( 5 ) end goal becoming sensitive available water resource optimising use stormwater pipe urban water waterway flood control , aquifer recharge

overall rainfall , also ready deal heavy rainfall storm occur. ” bushfire condition air quality : “ sydney community prepared aware respond period bushfire poor air quality. ” city also identify level ambition ( , inversely , tolerable risk level ) key climate risk identified ccra . lowest highest scale ambition , consider whether city : ( ) accept current level risk , aiming prevent risk becoming worse ; ( b ) reduce climate risk ; ( c ) reduce climate risk seek opportunity value creation . identify appropriate mix adaptation action , including reactive , preventative transformative response three overlapping complementary category adaptation strategy . adaptation action intervention achieve given strategy , including policy , project , programme , partnership activity . reactive adaptation fight immediate negative consequence climate-related hazard , protecting quality life city ’ system climate-related disaster restoring afterwards . reactive adaptation action might include temporary increase frontline hospital service heatwave , rolling sandbag divert water provision emergency raft flood , temporary water purchasing drought . reactive adaptation rapidly effective short term , benefit short lived . cost high repeated intervention needed intervention may insufficient deal future climate hazard . preventative adaptation reduces negative consequence climate-related hazard , aiming protect quality life city system avoid hazard event becoming disaster . action include construction flood wall coastal protection , installation energy-efficient air conditioning public building , water rationing , example . preventative adaptation option tend relatively expensive medium-longer term may sufficient mitigate city ’ future climate risk . however , effective reducing near-term risk often relatively straightforward plan , use well-established method technology . transformative adaptation tackle root cause climate risk , making climate-related hazard le likely severe fundamental change city ’ fabric system . transformative action include expanding city ’ green infrastructure reduce urban heat risk flooding drought , installation water reuse system , implementation building code require high energy efficiency cool roof . transformative adaptation action deliver greatest protection climate risk reduce need reactive preventative measure , additional benefit city resident . upfront implementation cost tend higher , design implementation transformative adaptation measure complex , requiring input wide range stakeholder , cheaper approach long term . city identify mix reactive , preventative transformative action view reducing main climate risk impact identified ccra , informed assessment root cause . transformative action well represented mix – without , city likely ‘ lock ’ climate risk require continuous reactive preventative measure may become inadequate expensive city support longer term . ideally , city plan use reactive action risk deemed acceptable residual risk expected remain proactive transformative adaptation measure implemented . develop target adaptation action priority action identified adaptation target usually strategy- action-specific , usually set following action prioritisation stage climate action planning . target quantitative linked output , outcome impact planned action , example , number tree planted ( output ) , square metre percentage shaded public space ( outcome ) , reduction hospital admission heat wave ( impact ) . ideally , city set target action medium high risk . c40 report focused adaptation set effective adaptation action city take , depending context , inform step climate action planning process . workshop prompt support process identifying action collaboration public , private community stakeholder . initial action identification produce informed longlist adaptation option taken forward refined action prioritisation stage . worked example : ccra , goal setting action wuhan wuhan ’ ccra showed city facing pluvial flooding waterlogging , alongside scarce freshwater resource . climate change expected make situation worse . part adaptation strategy , wuhan established goal eliminating waterlogging , retaining rainwater later use preventing urban flooding . wuhan since implemented transformative measure , including initiation 300 ‘ sponge city ’ project , using green infrastructure increase infiltration create natural drainage system . sponge city concept promoted chinese government also implemented chinese city , including zhenjiang . workshop step
