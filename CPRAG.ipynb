      "1. **Evidence-based roadmap**: Develop a roadmap that is grounded in science and internationally accepted targets, such as the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to 1.5°C. Ensure that your plan is based on credible data and incorporates stakeholder input.\n",
      "2. **Unique city context and challenges**: Recognize that every city has its unique context, challenges, and opportunities. Develop a plan that responds to these factors and addresses the specific needs and priorities of your city.\n",
