      "[Document(page_content='Title: Climate budgeting: What it is, what it isn’t, and how it works\\nContent: Climate budgeting puts climate at the heart of decision-making, alongside other priority areas, helping to drive the short-term action that is so desperately needed. This article defines exactly what climate budgeting is, what it isn’t, and introduces how it works. For more on the benefits of adopting one, read Climate budgets: Why your city needs one.\\nClimate budgeting is a governance system for delivering climate targets\\nA climate budget is a governance system that mainstreams climate commitments and considerations into decision-making on policies, actions and budget. This is done by integrating climate targets from the city’s Climate Action Plan (CAP) into the financial budgeting process and assigning responsibility for implementation, monitoring, evaluation and reporting across the city government. It creates transparency and accountability, and highlights deviations from targets.\\nA climate budget establishes a city’s short-term targets and actions, typically every year or two, to deliver the long-term climate targets of the city’s CAP. As part of the financial budgeting process and in line with the budgetary cycle, the city proposes, adopts, implements, monitors and reports on climate measures to meet short-term targets. The climate budget should state clear targets and actions. It should also state, wherever possible, the estimated emission reduction effects over time, as well as the costs and financing involved.\\nThe climate budget should initially cover actions financed by the budget. It should then be expanded to include actions implemented by using all instruments at the city government’s disposal (for example, regulation and policy). The climate budget also identifies action areas that are the responsibility of national and regional governments, business communities and residents, providing a basis for horizontal and vertical integration and collaboration.\\nThe climate budget should initially cover city-wide Global Protocol for Community-Scale (GPC) BASIC-level emissions and could be built out over time to include consumption-based emissions, climate adaptation, equity and inclusivity, and more.\\nClimate budgeting and climate action planning\\nTo develop a climate budget, a form of climate strategy that sets medium- and long-term targets is needed. Ideally, this will be a CAP, in line with the ambitions of the Paris Agreement, establishing a high-level political commitment to climate action and evidence-based climate goals, strategies and priority actions. A CAP does not typically include a detailed year-by-year costed strategy for implementing the actions it identifies. A climate budget operationalises the CAP or equivalent planning document, turning its strategies and priorities into short-term, granular, feasible, funded measures to be implemented within the next financial year. It may build and draw on governance structures established for the CAP to support this.\\nWhat is climate governance?\\nClimate governance refers to the formal and informal rules, structures, processes and systems that define and influence action on climate change. It is a multi-level decision-making process with interaction between and within different levels of government – local, regional, national and global – and various other actors.\\nWhat is climate mainstreaming?\\nCity climate action has typically been siloed as the responsibility of a single climate or environmental department, leading to a lack of ownership of climate action across other government departments and a lack of resources and financial support that critically undermines the ambition and effectiveness of climate action. Climate mainstreaming is the systematic integration of climate considerations throughout a city’s entire strategy and operations. It makes climate mitigation and adaptation considerations routine and integrated into department’s day-to-day work. Climate budgeting is an effective approach to mainstreaming. Read How to use climate budgeting to mainstream climate action across the city government to learn more and How to mainstream climate action into your city’s financial system for other ideas.\\nClimate budgeting sits under the broad umbrella of green budgeting\\nGreen budgeting uses the tools of budgetary policymaking to further environmental and climate goals. This includes evaluating the environmental impacts of budgetary and fiscal policies and assessing their coherence with the delivery of national and international commitments.1 Green budgeting involves a range of methodologies that interact with governance on different levels.\\nOne prevalent method of green budgeting is a budget climate assessment (BCA). A BCA is a form of budget tagging that evaluates budget lines to determine their mitigation and/or adaptation impact. BCAs are a valuable assessment of the climate impacts of expenditures, highlighting areas that may be responsible for large proportions of emissions. They have been deployed by Barcelona and several French municipalities, including Paris. A project climate assessment (PCA) is a similar approach, which is used to assess the climate impacts of a single action, such as a budget proposal, investment or plan. PCAs have been deployed as a decision-making tool in cities including Berlin and Montréal.\\nA PCA can be used when developing a climate budget to assess the mitigation impacts of budget lines or projects and to support the prioritisation of action, while a BCA can provide a baseline and show changes in the greenness of the city’s spending over time. Data and tools for climate budgeting includes examples of BCAs and PCAs. In contrast to climate budgeting, however, a BCA is primarily used for budgets that have already been adopted and gives no guidance on how expenditures should be modified to reduce emissions. To date, it has not been used in the budget development process.\\nA climate budget is not a carbon budget\\nThey are related, however. A carbon (or emission) budget is the cumulative amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions permitted within a specified timeframe to keep within safe limits of global heating. It is a technical assessment that produces science-based annual caps on GHG-emissions over a period of time. If your city has established long-term emission reduction targets as part of a climate action planning process, this will determine the long-term carbon budget, which can then be broken down into annual emission limits – giving the city something to ‘budget towards’. Stockholm, for example, has taken this step. A climate budget then ensures that a carbon budget or emissions reduction target is integrated into a city’s daily operations and policies.\\nThe below graphic explains how these components can connect to and inform each other:\\nIf your city is considering adopting a climate budget, visit Climate Budgets for more guidance on the benefits, leading examples, tools and advice.\\n\\n'), Document(page_content='Title: Enabling Sustainable Lifestyles in a Climate Emergency\\nContent: Read how cities can reduce consumption-based emissions through sustainable procurement policies, regulations, community-planning and political leadership.\\nGlobally, high-income countries are responsible for a disproportionate share of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, with the wealthiest 10% of the world’s population contributing to half of global emissions. This UNEP policy brief explores how cities can change consumption patterns to tackle climate change.\\nThe report tasks governments and businesses to lead the charge with sweeping measures that will make it easier for citizens and households to live more sustainably. It offers insights on the forces that shape our lifestyles, from values and norms to economic factors and government regulations, all of which are underpinned by the physical infrastructure within which we live.\\nBased on analysis conducted by the Hot or Cool Institute the report recommends actions in four areas of everyday living: reduce car dependence and carbon intensive long-distance travel; address unsustainable energy use in residential buildings; shift from meat to plant-rich and alternative diets; and eliminate fast fashion.\\nThe brief also introduces the policy tool of ‘choice-editing’ as a key mechanism to lead the transition to sustainable lifestyles. By applying the choice-editing framework, policy makers can shape the structural factors that constrain our lifestyle choices. They can edit out harmful lifestyle and consumption options and edit in more desirable alternatives and ensure that everyone has access to life’s necessities.\\nKey recommendations from the policy brief include:\\nConsider the drivers of lifestyles, which can contribute to significant changes when addressed together: attitudes (knowledge, media, values, norms); facilitators (incentives and disincentives); and infrastructures (physical and technological).\\nApply choice-editing framework for just and sustainable transitions: edit out harmful options (ban ads of carbon intensive products); edit in sustainable alternatives (develop cycling lanes and public transport); and ensure fair access to all (subsidise loans to incentivize homes retrofitting).\\nTackle high impact lifestyle sectors, and build on transformations already happening in your city, such as car-free transportation, sustainable housing, plant-rich diets, and sustainable fashion.\\nWatch Lewis Akenji, Managing Director of Hot or Cool Institute, present this framework:\\n\\n  \\n'), Document(page_content='Title: Climate Action Planning Vertical Integration Guide\\nContent: Effectively aligning efforts to address climate change across national, provincial and city government levels – vertical integration – helps to facilitate faster, more ambitious climate action. It means coordinating climate policies, plans and implementation across different levels of government, maximising the potential of each level through collective efforts, and promoting top-down and bottom-up information exchange.\\nThis guide explains the principles and practices of enabling climate action through vertical integration, and provides a series of good practice examples from around the world. It also introduces a suite of tools and resources which can help city governments to evaluate barriers and opportunities for vertical integration, and support the planning and implementation of strategies to improve it.\\nWatch the three minute video below for an introduction to vertical integration as an enabler for climate action planning, and to the supporting tools and resources.'), Document(page_content='Title: Who should foot the climate bill in your city? The fossil fuel industry.\\nContent: By Josh Stanbro, Senior Policy Director, Honolulu City Council and former Executive Director of the Office of Climate Change, Sustainability and Resiliency, City and County of Honolulu\\nImagine you’re a parent who just discovered that the baby formula you relied on to raise your child turned out to cause long-term health issues through their life as an adult. Now imagine you found out that the company that produced the formula knew all along about the toxic ingredients, and actively covered up evidence and efforts to reveal the danger – while continuing to sell the product to you, and millions of other parents.\\nThis isn’t a hypothetical question. Mayors and Councilmembers are often as protective of their city residents as they are their families, and the information increasingly coming to light about the ravaging impacts of climate change and the active deception by the fossil fuel industry has forced many municipal leaders to acknowledge the threat not only to our children, but to all of us.\\nWe’ve wrestled with this issue here in Honolulu over the past several years as roads slipped into the ocean and flooding surged through our neighborhoods, all while we learned that the fossil fuel industry:\\nKnew for more than 50 years that their oil, gas, and coal products would cause rising sea levels, more destructive storms, more frequent and severe wildfires and droughts, and other impacts from climate change that their own experts warned could be ‘severe’ or even ‘catastrophic’; and\\nSpent billions of dollars on decades-long campaigns to deceive the public, press, and decision-makers about those impacts – while quietly taking steps to protect their own assets, like oil rigs, from climate impacts they knew were coming.\\nThe fossil fuel industry has pumped more than half of all total historical worldwide carbon emissions into our atmosphere since 1990, a timeframe when their campaign of deceit was at its height.\\nWe’ve also learned that it will cost Honolulu hundreds of millions of dollars – at least – to plan, design, and implement infrastructure upgrades and other measures to avoid or adapt to climate impacts. Already, the new and increasing chaos and adaptation costs imposed by climate change are straining budgets and forcing difficult choices. 2019 was the hottest year on record here in Hawaiʻi, and as our sister cities and towns across the United States are again being scorched with ’unprecedented’ heat and drought and headed into another dangerous wildfire season, global heating poses multiple risks to our own frontline communities. Increasing drought here threatens our island fresh water supplies, even while ‘rainbombs’ are becoming increasingly common, overwhelming our storm water infrastructure and flooding neighborhoods. A warming ocean is bleaching the coral reefs that protect us from storm surge, and sea level rise is robbing our beaches and overwhelming our roads, especially on the windward side of our island.\\nMeanwhile, the five biggest oil companies alone made more than $2 trillion in net profits while they were lying to the world about climate change and its consequences.\\nThat’s why the Honolulu City Council voted unanimously in late 2019 to file a lawsuit in state court here in Hawaiʻi, aiming to hold a group of these companies including Exxon, Chevron, and Shell accountable for the damage they’ve caused, the dangerous misinformation they’ve spread, and the skyrocketing costs they’ve imposed on our taxpayers and island community. We went to court because there are stark equity and fairness issues at play. Our residents are already facing physical and mental health impacts, and they should not have to foot the bill for financial costs knowingly imposed on them while the industry walks away with massive profits.\\nCritically, we’re not alone. Honolulu is one of 26 cities, counties, and states across the United States which have now filed similar suits against fossil fuel companies. Nearly all of these lawsuits are moving forward – including ours – despite big oil’s desperate efforts to delay proceedings. So far, nine federal district court judges and four federal courts of appeal have rejected the defendants’ attempt to remove the cases from state court to federal court – where they think they have a better chance of winning. In fact, the only judge who declined to send two cases back to local courts was, rightly, overturned on appeal. Here in Honolulu our lawsuit is now moving forward in state court as well.\\nNone of these defeats has stopped the fossil fuel industry. They continue to deceive and delay by mischaracterizing the lawsuits and attacking the public officials involved. They are even pushing federal legislation that would provide them with immunity, robbing cities and local jurisdictions like ours of a critical tool for holding the fossil fuel corporations accountable when they knowingly inflict harm on our citizens. The new ‘model’ state legislation pushed by the American Legislative Exchange Council to restrict cities’ access to the courts is emblematic of these aggressive efforts to protect their profits at the expense of our citizens.\\nThe good news is that cities are aware, and united. In June 2019, former Honolulu Mayor Caldwell co-sponsored a Resolution passed unanimously by the US Conference of Mayors (USCOM) that opposed legislative efforts – whether at the state or federal level – to give fossil fuel companies immunity from liability for climate change damages and their deception. Both USCOM and the National League of Cities have also filed ‘friend of the court’ briefs supporting lawsuits like ours. Late last year, our neighbors in Maui County filed their own lawsuit to hold fossil fuel companies accountable. We have a word for this in the Hawaiian language – kakou – which means “in this together”. And when communities come together, we’re stronger.\\nIslands are being hit first and worst by the climate crisis. We in Honolulu encourage cities across the nation and across the globe not only to take stock of the climate change impacts on your doorstep, but also to take steps to make sure those who profited by deception pay their fair share, now that the climate bill is coming due. You’d not only be joining, and strengthening, a growing movement for climate justice and equity – you’ll be protecting the best interests of the next generation of citizens as well.\\nThis was first published in September 2020 as part of Spotlight On: Cities Work Together and updated by the author in July 2021 to coincide with the release of Spotlight On: Legal Action.'), Document(page_content='Title: IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C\\nContent: In December 2015, 195 countries endorsed the Paris Agreement, which backed a long-term goal to limit global temperature rise to ‘well below 2°C’ above pre-industrial levels, and to pursue efforts towards a rise of 1.5°C. As part of the Paris Agreement, the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was invited to provide a special report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5°C, and the global greenhouse gas emission pathways necessary to meet that goal.\\nThe subsequent IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR1.5) was released in 2018, based on an extremely comprehensive review the available research. It presented, for the first time, alarming evidence that half a degree of global warming makes a big difference: the risks associated with warming of 2°C are substantially higher than 1.5°C. We need to act now to prevent catastrophic climate change and escalating impacts.\\nAs a result of this report, the internationally accepted target for climate action is to limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C – not 2°C.\\nAlongside main report, the IPCC produced a Summary for Policymakers. The Summary explains:\\nAn introduction to global warming of 1.5°C. Key points include that human activity is estimated to have already caused approximately 1°C of global warming above pre-industrial levels, and that warming is likely to reach 1.5°C between 2030 and 2052 if it continues to increase at the current rate.\\nThe potential impacts and associated risks of 1.5°C warming, relative to 2°C warming, for human and natural systems. This makes clear that warming of 2°C presents significantly greater risks than warming of 1.5°C, including higher climate-related risks to health, livelihoods, food security, water supply, human security and economic growth. Adaptation needs are also higher for 2°C warming.\\nThe greenhouse gas emissions pathways consistent with 1.5°C global warming. The graphic below summarises the global net emissions required for pathways limiting global warming to 1.5°C, with no (or limited) overshoot, and with higher overshoot. Pathways with higher overshoot allow emissions reductions to happen more slowly and but require greater negative emissions (net removal of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere) to compensate, in order to reach the 1.5°C target.\\nSource: IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C\\nGuidance on strengthening the global response in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty. The global emissions outcome of the current nationally stated mitigation ambitions, as submitted under the Paris Agreement, are not enough to limit global warming to 1.5°C. Global greenhouse gas emissions need to start to decline well before 2030.\\nThe report itself – including, to a lesser degree, the Summary for Policymakers - is an extensive, detailed and technical resource which can be challenging to interpret.\\nFor an accessible overview of the report’s findings and policy implications, read:\\nClimate science tells us that 1.5°C is likely to become the most important number in human history, a blog by Mark Watts, C40 Cities Executive Director.\\nThe Summary for Urban Policymakers, in which the Global Covenant of Mayors, C40 Cities and 18 IPCC 1.5°C Special Report lead authors summarise key information for cities.\\nFor Cities by Cities: Key Takeaways for City Decision Makers from the IPCC 1.5°C Report and Summary for Urban Policymakers.\\n  “For more than a decade now, mayors of the world’s great cities have been the loudest voices calling for bold and urgent climate action, because we are conscious of the threat it poses to our citizens. We have committed to deliver on the 1.5°C target of the Paris Agreement because it is clear this offers the best hope of securing a healthy, prosperous and sustainable future for all citizens around the globe. Cities are ready to lead on the transformations necessary to secure the future that we want, the future we can trust.”\\nAnne Hidalgo, Mayor of Paris, Chair of C40 Cities and Board Member of the Global Covenant of Mayors\\n  “The sobering conclusion of the Summary for Urban Policy Makers is that we need to pursue aggressive strategies to limit global heating to 1.5°C, while preparing our towns, cities and regions for warming already underway. 1.5°C is likely to become the most important number in human history. It is already the target adopted by C40, since 2016, as the level of ambition needed to be part of our network. Thanks to this report every city leader worldwide can now match that level of ambition.”\\nMark Watts, Executive Director, C40 Cities\\n  “The science is unequivocal – the urban system is one of four global systems in which we need rapid, far reaching and unprecedented change if we are to limit global warming to 1.5°C. The report is clear that this ramping up of urban climate ambition should begin today if we are to see a just transition to a sustainable, low carbon, climate resilient world.”\\nDebra Roberts, Co-Chair of Working Group II of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)\\n  “There is no historical precedent for this kind of coordination, and systemic change at this scale will require a coordinated effort on many fronts, as well as solution-driven and outcome-oriented partnerships. The Summary for Urban Policymakers of the IPCC SR1.5 is a first step in that direction and something our new Innovate4Cities initiative aims to replicate.”\\nAmanda Eichel, Executive Director, Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy\\n\\n')]\n"
