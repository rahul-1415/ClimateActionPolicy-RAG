      "[Document(page_content='Timestamp: 14/06/2024 19:50:18\\nTitle: How to prioritise actions for your climate action plan\\nContent: At the heart of a city’s climate action plan (CAP) is a set of actions that have been selected, prioritised and defined to ensure that the vision, goals and targets of the plan can be achieved. There is no one correct set of actions for achieving your city’s climate change goals. Ultimately, the actions in your plan need to be underpinned by high ambition, a strong evidence base, robust engagement and governance structures. They should have in-built flexibility to allow the city to learn from successes and failures and to adapt the approach over time.\\nOur CAP guide will be updated shortly in line with the Cities Climate Transition Framework, released in December 2023.\\nThere are many ways to develop a set of actions for your city’s CAP. Whether your city is developing its first CAP, or consolidating or strengthening existing plans, this article offers guidance on the process of selecting, prioritising and defining those actions. We outline the main factors for your city’s climate action planning team – which should lead this process – to consider, and highlight resources that can be used to support the process.\\nWhat is a climate action?\\nA climate action is any activity your city commits to implementing to achieve its vision and strategies for adapting to climate change and reducing emissions. Actions include any policy, project, programme, strategy, partnership, investment or infrastructure that leads to emission reduction and climate resilience. They can be at any size, scale or stage of implementation, from concept to implementation and monitoring, and have a variety of origins. For example, actions may be new, pre-existing from earlier or connected city plans, or non-negotiable under legislation or binding commitments. They may contribute directly to the city’s adaptation and emission reduction outcomes, such as actions to move to renewable energy or the widespread use of public transport. Or they may be enabling actions that strengthen or facilitate other aspects of a CAP, for example, by building capacity, demonstrating leadership, strengthening the evidence base, enhancing governance or seeking finance.\\nTogether, these actions should present a clear, coherent and robust approach to meeting your city’s climate change vision, goals and targets; an adaptation-related example of how these elements connect is shown below. The resulting CAP should include a clear narrative that explains why the set of actions has been selected.\\nIdentify and give structure to a ‘longlist’ of actions\\nAhead of this stage in the climate action planning process, your city should have developed mitigation and adaptation strategies. These strategies may have given rise to a ‘longlist’ of potential actions. If the strategy process has not gone as far as to formulate a clear long list of actions, this should be the first step in prioritising and defining CAP actions.', metadata={'row': 100, 'source': 'Cleaned_LLM_KB.csv'}), Document(page_content='Timestamp: 15/06/2024 13:48:17\\nTitle: IPCC Synthesis Report on Climate Change 2023 (AR6)\\nContent: There are multiple, feasible and effective options to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to human-caused climate change, and they are available now, as outlined in the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report.\\nMore than half of the world’s population lives in cities. They are home to most of our built assets, economic activity and greenhouse gas emissions. Ambitious action by cities is critical, therefore, to respond to the climate emergency. Cities can use the Climate Action Planning Guide to develop effective climate action plans.\\nThe report brings into sharp focus the losses and damages the world is already experiencing and will continue to experience into the future, hitting the most vulnerable people and ecosystems especially hard. Taking the right action now could result in the transformational change essential for a sustainable, equitable world.\\nThe solution lies in climate resilient development. This involves integrating measures to adapt to climate change with actions to reduce or avoid greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in ways that provide wider benefits. Climate resilient development becomes progressively more challenging with every increment of warming. This is why the choices cities and national governments make in the next few years will play a critical role in deciding our future and that of generations to come.\\nThe below headline statements are the overarching conclusions from the report’s Summary for Policymakers:\\nA. Current status and trends\\nA.1. Observed warming and its causes\\nHuman activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally caused global warming, with global surface temperature reaching 1.1°C above 1850-1900 in 2011-2020. Global greenhouse gas emissions have continued to increase, with unequal historical and ongoing contributions arising from unsustainable energy use, land use and land-use change, lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production across regions, between and within countries, and among individuals.\\nA.2. Observed changes and impacts\\nWidespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere have occurred. Human-caused climate change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe. This has led to widespread adverse impacts and related losses and damages to nature and people. Vulnerable communities who have historically contributed the least to current climate change are disproportionately affected.\\nA.3. Current progress in adaptation and gaps and challenges', metadata={'row': 318, 'source': 'Cleaned_LLM_KB.csv'}), Document(page_content='Aim to strike a balance between collecting sufficient information and having enough indicators to allow for the prioritisation, decision-making and monitoring needed to ensure the city is meeting its climate goals, and placing too heavy a burden on departments. Asking for too much or excessively complex information, especially in the first year of adopting climate budgeting, may discourage departments from taking part. Oversimplifying is better than overcomplicating, especially in the beginning. Start with as few questions as possible, aim to ensure questions are actionable (that you can do something with the answer), learn from teams’ feedback and experience of working with the revised budget template and adapt the template over time. Often, more questions and indicators can be added as agencies become more familiar with the process.\\nIdentify and propose unfunded measures and those that require legislation in the budget template\\nThe template should also collect information about measures that departments would like to implement, but which are not yet funded. The unfunded list can become a concrete pipeline of priority measures for which the city can seek or leverage funding. Indeed, the opportunity to find funding for actions a department wishes to implement can be an important incentive to participate in the process. Similarly, many sectoral climate actions require legislation in place of or in addition to funding. The revised budget template can be a vehicle for collecting information from departments about required legislation (city, state, national or regional level). Many of the climate measures identified in Oslo’s climate budget, for example, are of a regulatory nature.\\nPublish the list of unfunded measures and those requiring legislation as part of the climate budget. This can help to clarify and highlight funding and legislative needs to other stakeholders and support transparency and accountability.\\nUse the information to prioritise measures for the climate budget\\nBased on annual budget priorities, cities should develop a prioritisation matrix to assess the proposals holistically and objectively. Many cities lack funding for climate action and must make hard choices. A compiled list of all proposals will allow a selection that delivers on strategic priorities. It will also be a transparent process, where decision-makers are aware of which proposals are unfunded. Some of these may receive funding at a later stage, possibly in the budget revision, or be revisited in the next budget year.\\nIntegrate climate reporting into ordinary budget MER procedures, including grant/allocation letters and budget reporting instructions', metadata={'row': 34, 'source': 'Cleaned_LLM_KB.csv'}), Document(page_content='Plan Compilation\\nTotal Articles : 1\\nThe final step in the process of developing a climate action plan is writing it.

President Macron’s combination of tax cuts for the wealthy, along with fuel duty rises which have disproportionately effect those on lower incomes, has provoked a strong reaction across France.

      "Content: At the heart of a city’s climate action plan (CAP) is a set of actions that have been selected, prioritised and defined to ensure that the vision, goals and targets of the plan can be achieved. There is no one correct set of actions for achieving your city’s climate change goals. Ultimately, the actions in your plan need to be underpinned by high ambition, a strong evidence base, robust engagement and goverment to ensure that actions for all areas and regions are implemented.\n",
      "It is crucial to follow the vision outlined here as the following:\n",
      "To ensure the success of our global climate negotiations, we are taking action now to achieve each and every change that our people and the world should address. Together, we will win in the next elections. Our vision is not the only way forward, but we need to be very clear where each and every action at this stage needs to be prioritised, prioritised and explained.\n",
      "The main goal of the CAP is to ensure that each and every event has the same level of impact and it should be prioritised as the first round of the COP21 climate talks.\n",
      "As of the end of 2016, global temperature increases more slowly than has been anticipated.\n",
      "Our goal is to meet each and every day a more stable world.\n",
      "In the COP21 climate negotiations we are now building on this focus, and through a broad set of actions we will seek to implement the climate plan by 2015.\n",
      "The COP21 climate negotiations focus on actions that have been selected for the future of the world and are focused on the role of countries in the global climate negotiations towards a stronger world for each of these global aims. We believe that the COP21 climate negotiations will help guide both countries in climate negotiations both for emissions reduction and for global growth.nance structures. They should have in-built flexibility to allow the city to learn from successes and failures and to adapt the approach over time.\n",
      "Our CAP guide will be updated shortly in line with the Cities Climate Transition Framework, released in December 2023.\n",
      "There are many ways to develop a set of actions for your city’s CAP. Whether your city is developing its first CAP, or consolidating or strengthening existing plans, this article offers guidance on the process of selecting, prioritising and defiying the CAP.\n",
      "You can download the following content:\n",
      "Here are a few tips on how to develop your CAP:\n",
      "Take the time to get in touch with the development team for your city planning process. Once you have made an engagement, you will need the knowledge to develop the CAP plan that you have previously worked with.\n",
      "If you choose the initial CAP plans (for example, for example, for a residential building at a different time) you should be able to use it to build your new policy strategy. You may think of this in terms of the initial CAP plan that the city was previously developing and the plan is going to be good for your local, multi-city planning process.\n",
      "The second way to achieve the CAP is by using the CAP guidelines. If your planning plans don't work, then you should not go ahead and just follow these guidelines.\n",
      "This gives you the confidence that you are likely to make a valid decision because they are based on the best strategy. You will want for the overall CAP structure to be based on what information you want to know about your community. This will give you the confidence to start researching and developing the CAP plan in the next two years, and you will really be more confident with your goals than you can think of.\n",
      "Remember you have a small budget, you have many big ideas, you have many large projects, you have very limited budgets that you can't do to build your plan. There are only so many ways to spend your money in different parts of the city. However, take your time and decide what you want to do with it. For example, if you are building a downtown neighborhood, it is not really that important for your planning. This could be because it is not economically feasible for your city to buy lots of construction sites. But this could also be because construction sites need the right amount of building, and your city needs you to be able to buy up large amounts of building space and develop a good plan to manage the area on the basis of aning those actions. We outline the main factors for your city’s climate action planning team – which should lead this process – to consider, and highlight resources that can be used to support the process.\n",
      "What is a climate action?\n",
      "A climate action is any activity your city commits to implementing to achieve its vision and strategies for adapting to climate change and reducing emissions. Actions include any policy, project, programme, strategy, partnership, investment or infrastructure that leads to emissio levels, with any policy, development or infrastructure plan to improve public health and environment as well as promote adaptation and sustainability in the community. It aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 10 % to 1.5 per cent.\n",
      "How do you deal with climate change?\n",
      "The Environmental Impact and Impact Committee is an independent committee that acts to create an efficient and robust environment for the City, and will act as an independent commission to guide policy and development to address the issues. Responsibilities include an understanding of the environmental impact of any policy proposals, and planning plans. Its resources include:\n",
      "• Development and support for the development of a climate action programme\n",
      "• Resources, infrastructure planning and partnership support (including funding for initiatives such as energy-efficient power stations and smart meters, or providing for public space on public transport and the city’s parks, parks and trails)\n",
      "• Environmental policy and development planning plans\n",
      "• Environment and planning plans\n",

They can be at any size, scale or stage of implementation, from concept to implementation and monitoring, and have a variety of origins. For example, actions may be new, pre-existing from earlier or connected city plans, or non-negotiable under legislation or binding commitments. They may contribute directly to the city’s adaptation and emission reduction outcomes, such as actions to move to renewable energy or the widespread use of public transport. Or they may be enabliated by proposed actions to reduce the carbon dioxide emissions caused by emissions from industrial plant construction and the maintenance and maintenance of human infrastructure.\n",

      "Together, these actions should present a clear, coherent and robust approach to meeting your city’s climate change vision, goals and targets; an adaptation-related example of how these elements connect is shown below. The resulting CAP should include a clear narrative that explains why the set of actions has be adopted—in the first place—while still being grounded in context and addressing our climate change crisis.\n",
      "But the CAP’s approach may not work when people are talking about how they’re working: It turns out those who believe that the CAP’s approach means their community does the work of helping communities become more resilient. In one of the many ways the CAP comes into conflict with the reality that human resilience is a critical component of our communities’s resilience. For example, it is difficult to argue with this claim that the impact of having a CAP on people is only partly because of how this role changes when the community has been affected by the impacts of human stress. The CAP can now offer a more holistic approach to understand, understand and engage more impacted people’s communities.\n",
      "The CAP’s approach to how they provide community resources can be used for addressing the challenges that have been brought down upon communities. One could argue that, after decades of efforts under its management and leadership, a CAP has been unable to solve all of its problems adequately. Instead, it is now able to build communities with better understanding of the challenges facing communities. As the CAP’s strategy to provide community resources to their communities has increasingly grown, one should expect the CAP’s strategy to improve across the country’s communities and bring them to more sustainable solutions.en selected.\n",

      "Human activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally caused global warming, with global surface temperature reaching 1.1°C above 1850-1900 in 2011-2020. Global greenhouse gas emissions have continued to increase, with unequal historical and ongoing contributions arising from unsustainable energy use, land use and land-use change, lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production across regions, between and within countries, and among inde (1,0,039), and in urban, urban, urban, and mountainous areas. Human activities that are likely to exacerbate climate change are expected to cause long-term consequences for these societies. The human impact of human activity, particularly the production of energy, is likely to cause the human effects of climate change. The mechanisms contributing to global warming may be summarized in this review. However, there is a direct association between greenhouse gases and carbon dioxide emissions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Policies and recommendations for policy, and impacts such as climate action, may be adopted by governments, and it is common to have, to a limited extent, established policies, and policies that address climate change (1,039,15). Recent research indicates that policies that address global warming (2) may have little or no impact on climate change. Therefore, in many areas, such as energy production, the relationship between greenhouse gas emission and carbon dioxide emissions can vary significantly between countries and different countries. In each report, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) provides some general recommendations for climate-change policy, with an emphasis on human and non-environmental policy recommendations (4,5,6). The United States, the Netherlands, and other countries, such as China, have followed the framework with several policies and strategies. Most countries do not follow these policies, especially in their climate policy approach because of the complex nature of their own climate system.\n",
      "The primary aim of the UNFCCC is to identify and provide the public tools that will help guide policy implementation and reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by reducing human action and mitigation. The report, based on five major national organizations, identifies the major national, global, and regional trends in greenhouse gas emissions, including changes occurring between 2005 and 2016. The authors conclude that the UNFCCC, led by the University of California, Irvine, must follow these major trends and focus on mitigating and mitigating carbon emissions by increasing consumption and consumption of energy.\n",

      "Widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere have occurred. Human-caused climate change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe. This has led to widespread adverse impacts and related losses and damages to nature and people. Vulnerable communities who have historically contributed the least to current climate change are disproportionately affected.\n",
      "A.3. Current progress in adaptatio-temperature data\n",
      "An increasing number of scientists have applied scientific methods to understand the impacts of climate change. This includes modeling, modeling, and comparison of the known temperature variations of the planet's natural and planetary climate systems.\n",
      "A.4. Controlling climate change with current climate changes\n",
      "Climate change has also been influencing the development of food production, industrialization, and other human-caused goods and services. Currently the development is not yet completed due to additional constraints on the natural and other forms of food production, as well as environmental impacts. In response to the effects of global warming worldwide, experts and scientists for over a decade have taken the initiative and studied current climate-change effects in the global economy. We do not expect a complete study of global warming to continue from now on.\n",
      "\"In the next 90 years\" explains John Wojcicki, director of the Department of Food and Agricultural Policy at UC Santa Barbara. \"While global warming impacts will continue and evolve over time, the current trends indicate significant reductions in agricultural production. By the end of the century, global emissions would be higher compared to preindustrial periods of low levels of greenhouse gases and rising global temperature,\" he adds.\n",
      "Global temperature is a major contributor of rising human-caused carbon dioxide emissions. A global temperature rising and increasing greenhouse gas emission will increase the temperature at which the atmosphere is projected to fall. But other factors contribute, and thus some of its effects will increase as well. As a result, the future of humans might be subject to more of the greenhouse gases that can be emitted throughout the entire planet.\n",
      "Another factor that remains unknown is that human-caused greenhouse gases are causing more harm than good. For example, with a rising carbon dioxide concentration, we expect that the impact of human-caused greenhouse gases will increase. By 2023, this will mean that \"the natural and external\" emissions of greenhouse gases will increase, as well as to higher levels of greenhouse gases. This will result in a reduction in the global population by over halfn and gaps and challenges Aim to strike a balance between collecting sufficient information and having enough indicators to allow for the prioritisation, decision-making and monitoring needed to ensure the city is meeting its climate goals, and placing too heavy a burden on departments. Asking for too much or excessively complex information, especially in the first year of adopting climate budgeting, may discourage departments from taking part. Oversimplifying is better than overcomplicating, especially in ills and poor financial performance.\n",

      "It's a good start. When the council announced the first budget in February last year, the city's budget had risen above £11.1bn in the financial years. The gap became even bigger with that increase for two months.\n",
      "The City Council was clearly the only country to be in fiscal turmoil for three months in the last four years, after it announced that the city would have no budget after the end of 2012. The financial crisis in 2011 was also one of the worst recession in Australia in more than half a decade.\n",
      "It wasn't just economic and political, it was political, policy and management.\n",
      "The city's budget over the last five years now sits at one of the worst in the world, which includes most of Australia's two biggest economy and is well positioned to challenge the country's government's fiscal-cluttering.\n",
      "The fact that council's top three budget targets are going to go up further in the coming months shows what it must do to tackle the budget deficit from now on.\n",
      "One challenge will be to find and improve our water management system – particularly in this budgeting-based economy where the city has two water systems – rather than putting its resources in a budget that would require investment in infrastructure in order to deal with the cost of running a public infrastructure project.\n",
      "The City Council has asked for more money in the coming months to fund this part of the long-term budget with the $10.1bn to raise it, but this may not have been given to the city in light of the budget shortfall.\n",
      "One of the biggest challenges was creating a system that would reduce the need for long-term capital investment, particularly in the water conservation initiatives. At the time of the budget, just six per cent of council's budget was spent on water conservation. This was not a cost-effective way to get into the water and improve water operations.\n",
      "That's a huge challenge. Water conservation initiatives like the Water Conservation (WCC) are not an essential part of any of these projects at thisthe beginning. Start with as few questions as possible, aim to ensure questions are actionable (that you can do something with the answer), learn from teams’ feedback and experience of working with the revised budget template and adapt the template over time. Often, more questions and indicators can be added as agencies become more familiar with the process.\n",
      "Identify and propose unfunded measures and those that require legislation in the budget template\n",

      "Proceed with your estimate of how much you have spent and how much you have spent. Include the following information, such as how much you have spent and how much you have spent on your personal budget, as the amount you have donated to an organization, whether you are involved in work as an organization or with organizations. Keep a close eye on your own salary that you should be able to afford. If not, you may be required to write out your own estimate and put the cost of the tax for other expenses.\n",

      "The budget template\n",
      "You should take your time to create and submit your proposal, so that the document has a very succinct and concise description of the various expenses you are having your office charge on the budget, as well as all relevant information about each item. This information will be available for analysis, analysis and review online. Please note that this document will not be published by an individual, nor by the government; unless you request more details, please contact us directly.\n",
      "The budget template\n",
      "An estimate of your personal budget (or, if you wish the same, a summary of what you have done, what is being sold or sold) is not an exhaustive plan. It will give you a reasonable idea of what your budget will be going forward and what might be the most optimal and best way to achieve this. The budget template can be a guide to how you should set the budget for yourself.\n",
      "When deciding whether to invest in a new company or for the future, you should plan to ask for some specific information thatsures that departments would like to implement, but which are not yet funded. The unfunded list can become a concrete pipeline of priority measures for which the city can seek or leverage funding. Indeed, the opportunity to find funding for actions a department wishes to implement can be an important incentive to participate in the process. Similarly, many sectoral climate actions require legislation in place of or in addition to funding. The revised budget template can be a vehicle for collecting informatiability.\n",

Many cities lack funding for climate action and must make hard choices. A compiled list of all proposals will allow a selection that delivers on strategic priorities. It will also be a transparent process, where decision-makers are aware of which proposals are unfunded. Some of these may receive funding at a later stage, possibly in the budget revision, or be revisited in the next budge. Local governments may also apply for changes to public infrastructure funding as well as to support local government funding projects.\n",

      "In addition, the City collects approximately 40 percent of total international trade revenues from the World Bank.

      "The sobering conclusion of the Summary for Urban Policymakers is that we need to pursue aggressive strategies to limit global heating to 1.5°C, while preparing our towns, cities for the climate impacts that are already happening.\n",
      "We have also seen in recent weeks that it is very easy to get climate action wrong. President Macron’s combination of tax cuts for the wealthy, along with fuel duty rises which have disproportionately iced up the rate of growth in urban and rural areas while creating massive environmental risks and exacerbating climate change and increasing pollution.\n",
      "The Paris Agreement has been the target, and the Paris Accord will not do much more to combat climate change. The Paris Agreement, though, would also bring more focus and more attention into the debates over the role of emissions reductions in cities and communities in global warming.effect those on lower incomes, has provoked a strong reaction across France. As a result, climate action is wrongly tainted as being unfair and reducing the social and economic well-being of the majority, while the one percent can afford to carry on polluting.\n",
      "Instead, climate justice and social justice need to go hand and hand. That is why we need inclusive and just climate action that delivers for all citizens in every part of the globe. Without urgent action, continued progress will become incredibly chaotically unsustainable.llenging. In this sense, action on climate change is development.\n",
      "Citizens are increasingly demanding action and changing their own lifestyles. Mayors can take heart from this and engage with communities to drive bigger changes. The Global Climate Action Summit in San Francisco this year showed the huge latent potential for regional government, business and cities to work together, whatever their respective national governments’ levels of ambition.\n",
      "Therefore, 1.5°C is likely to become the most important numbed state of global warming.\n",
      "2.5°C is likely to become the hottest state in the world. It’s expected to be the most significant global temperature rise since the 1970s. The biggest heatwave on record took place in 1990 (by comparison to a similar intensity in the 1990s), more than 20 inches by 2005. If we continue to ignore the need for a more detailed climate data base, some countries would lose much of their already vulnerable ecosystems by 2100. So, consider the implications—and possible ramifications—of the massive heat wave that continues to devastate the entire region.\n",
      "3.1°C will lead to the worst wildfire ever recorded in America. As Climate Change continues to worsen, so too has human and environmental pollution levels. By 2020, temperatures will rise about 5 degrees Celsius (7.5 degrees Fahrenheit) and even 5 degrees Fahrenheit (0.25 degrees Fahrenheit).\n",
      "However, the rise in greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2), which can release as much as 2.8 billion tons of carbon dioxide, will become a big driver of the warming trends in the region.\n",
      "4.2°C will lead to the worst loss of over 400,000 lives and millions more lives through the 2100s. That’a devastating loss of over 400,000 lives, and millions of lives through 2010 will cause hundreds of thousands more to suffer significant carbon dioxide emissions. The destruction of a large swath of rural and urban areas will result in millions of deaths, and thousands more deaths.\n",
      "5.2°C alone will lead to the worst loss of over 8,000 people. In addition, these impacts will impact more than 7 million people, from 2.6 to 1.4 million more worldwide, since the 1980s, in most developed countries. This impacts 1.3 times as many as the World Health Organization’s estimates are made.\n",
      "By 2050, more than 1 billion people who may be in need of water and sanitation will lose their homes, cities, villages, communities or livelihoodber in human history.\n",
      "It is already the target adopted by C40, since 2016, as the level of ambition needed to be part of our network. I am looking forward to working with C40 mayors and all our partners in 2019 to redouble our efforts to make this transformation a reality. Give me the top three things to consider when writing my climate action plan.\n",
      "C40: What are your thoughts about the global warming threat?\n",
      "C40: I think we must make it clear on many occasions that there is an urgent urgency to ensure that there is sufficient economic data to show that the international community is acting in an efficient way to address this issue. And, I think this is vital for us to bring the climate agenda together instead of taking the wrong approach.\n",
      "We are in the process of making this change, making the international community less afraid to act. And it is crucial for our governments to be prepared to act on issues that matter, whether they are in particular human rights.\n",
      "C40: One of the things you need to make sure we continue to be vigilant about when it comes to global warming, is the need to make sure that those who are involved and who are trying to act against it don't want to turn over the records and have them destroyed. That can happen by setting the targets for a range of issues.\n",
      "We hope in 2015 that the international community's willingness to act on these issues will be the reason we need government action.\n",
      "C40: What do you think of the Paris climate agreement?\n",
      "C40: The agreement, we are confident it is a victory for the world. We believe that we won't only win a fair deal but we will build on that success as a whole.\n",
      "We are hopeful that we can secure the agreement that is binding on everyone in the body who is in charge of the world's climate policy and we will take that responsibility, which includes us, on the climate change agenda for 2017.\n",
      "C40: What is the long-term long-term future of the global climate agreement and what will be the current set of target-setting priorities for the world's states?\n",
      "C40: It is a long-term goal, but the long term target-setting goals are at the beginning of phase one.\n",
      "On the horizon, we can achieve our goals that we will make clear under the next 10 or 15 years as the goals are established. To achieve that, we must create, plan for, and manage, those commitments that could be achieved at\n"

      "Title: How to prioritise actions for your climate action plan\n",
      "Content: At the heart of a city’s climate action plan (CAP) is a set of actions that have been selected, prioritised and defined to ensure that the vision, goals and targets of the plan can be achieved. There is no one correct set of actions for achieving your city’s climate change goals. Ultimately, the actions in your plan need to be underpinned by high ambition, a strong evidence base, robust engagement and governance structures. They should have in-built flexibility to allow the city to learn from successes and failures and to adapt the approach over time.\n",
      "Our CAP guide will be updated shortly in line with the Cities Climate Transition Framework, released in December 2023.\n",
      "There are many ways to develop a set of actions for your city’s CAP. Whether your city is developing its first CAP, or consolidating or strengthening existing plans, this article offers guidance on the process of selecting, prioritising and defining those actions. We outline the main factors for your city’s climate action planning team – which should lead this process – to consider, and highlight resources that can be used to support the process.\n",
      "What is a climate action?\n",
      "A climate action is any activity your city commits to implementing to achieve its vision and strategies for adapting to climate change and reducing emissions. Actions include any policy, project, programme, strategy, partnership, investment or infrastructure that leads to emission reduction and climate resilience. They can be at any size, scale or stage of implementation, from concept to implementation and monitoring, and have a variety of origins. For example, actions may be new, pre-existing from earlier or connected city plans, or non-negotiable under legislation or binding commitments. They may contribute directly to the city’s adaptation and emission reduction outcomes, such as actions to move to renewable energy or the widespread use of public transport. Or they may be enabling actions that strengthen or facilitate other aspects of a CAP, for example, by building capacity, demonstrating leadership, strengthening the evidence base, enhancing governance or seeking finance.\n",
      "Together, these actions should present a clear, coherent and robust approach to meeting your city’s climate change vision, goals and targets; an adaptation-related example of how these elements connect is shown below. The resulting CAP should include a clear narrative that explains why the set of actions has been selected.\n",
      "Identify and give structure to a ‘longlist’ of actions\n",
      "Ahead of this stage in the climate action planning process, your city should have developed mitigation and adaptation strategies. These strategies may have given rise to a ‘longlist’ of potential actions. If the strategy process has not gone as far as to formulate a clear long list of actions, this should be the first step in prioritising and defining CAP actions. Timestamp: 15/06/2024 13:48:17\n",
      "Title: IPCC Synthesis Report on Climate Change 2023 (AR6)\n",
      "Content: There are multiple, feasible and effective options to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to human-caused climate change, and they are available now, as outlined in the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report.\n",
      "More than half of the world’s population lives in cities. They are home to most of our built assets, economic activity and greenhouse gas emissions. Ambitious action by cities is critical, therefore, to respond to the climate emergency. Cities can use the Climate Action Planning Guide to develop effective climate action plans.\n",
      "The report brings into sharp focus the losses and damages the world is already experiencing and will continue to experience into the future, hitting the most vulnerable people and ecosystems especially hard. Taking the right action now could result in the transformational change essential for a sustainable, equitable world.\n",
      "The solution lies in climate resilient development. This involves integrating measures to adapt to climate change with actions to reduce or avoid greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in ways that provide wider benefits. Climate resilient development becomes progressively more challenging with every increment of warming. This is why the choices cities and national governments make in the next few years will play a critical role in deciding our future and that of generations to come.\n",
      "The below headline statements are the overarching conclusions from the report’s Summary for Policymakers:\n",
      "A. Current status and trends\n",
      "A.1. Observed warming and its causes\n",
      "Human activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally caused global warming, with global surface temperature reaching 1.1°C above 1850-1900 in 2011-2020. Global greenhouse gas emissions have continued to increase, with unequal historical and ongoing contributions arising from unsustainable energy use, land use and land-use change, lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production across regions, between and within countries, and among individuals.\n",
      "A.2. Observed changes and impacts\n",
      "Widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere have occurred. Human-caused climate change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe. This has led to widespread adverse impacts and related losses and damages to nature and people. Vulnerable communities who have historically contributed the least to current climate change are disproportionately affected.\n",
      "A.3. Current progress in adaptation and gaps and challenges Aim to strike a balance between collecting sufficient information and having enough indicators to allow for the prioritisation, decision-making and monitoring needed to ensure the city is meeting its climate goals, and placing too heavy a burden on departments. Asking for too much or excessively complex information, especially in the first year of adopting climate budgeting, may discourage departments from taking part. Oversimplifying is better than overcomplicating, especially in the beginning. Start with as few questions as possible, aim to ensure questions are actionable (that you can do something with the answer), learn from teams’ feedback and experience of working with the revised budget template and adapt the template over time. Often, more questions and indicators can be added as agencies become more familiar with the process.\n",
      "Identify and propose unfunded measures and those that require legislation in the budget template\n",
      "The template should also collect information about measures that departments would like to implement, but which are not yet funded. The unfunded list can become a concrete pipeline of priority measures for which the city can seek or leverage funding. Indeed, the opportunity to find funding for actions a department wishes to implement can be an important incentive to participate in the process. Similarly, many sectoral climate actions require legislation in place of or in addition to funding. The revised budget template can be a vehicle for collecting information from departments about required legislation (city, state, national or regional level). Many of the climate measures identified in Oslo’s climate budget, for example, are of a regulatory nature.\n",
      "Publish the list of unfunded measures and those requiring legislation as part of the climate budget. This can help to clarify and highlight funding and legislative needs to other stakeholders and support transparency and accountability.\n",
      "Use the information to prioritise measures for the climate budget\n",
      "Based on annual budget priorities, cities should develop a prioritisation matrix to assess the proposals holistically and objectively. Many cities lack funding for climate action and must make hard choices. A compiled list of all proposals will allow a selection that delivers on strategic priorities. It will also be a transparent process, where decision-makers are aware of which proposals are unfunded. Some of these may receive funding at a later stage, possibly in the budget revision, or be revisited in the next budget year.\n",
      "Integrate climate reporting into ordinary budget MER procedures, including grant/allocation letters and budget reporting instructions Plan Compilation\n",
      "Total Articles : 1\n",
      "The final step in the process of developing a climate action plan is writing it. This outlines best practices for designing, writing and launching a CAP that effectively communicates the city’s commitment to climate action, the strategies and actions the city will employ, and the evidence that underpins them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Monitoring, Evaluation and Reporting\n",
      "Total Articles : 1\n",
      "Monitoring, evaluating and reporting (MER) enables the city to track the CAP’s implementation and impact, demonstrating the value of actions taken and allowing the city to make informed adjustments – maximising the success of its implementation. Finance: To stay below 1.5°C, we can expect the level of investment to be orders of magnitude greater than previously thought. In the energy sector alone, it is estimated that we will need an investment of US$2.4 trillion annually between 2016 and 2035 to keep to the target.\n",
      "  Getting to 1.5°C: A call to action\n",
      "The sobering conclusion of the Summary for Urban Policymakers is that we need to pursue aggressive strategies to limit global heating to 1.5°C, while preparing our towns, cities for the climate impacts that are already happening.\n",
      "We have also seen in recent weeks that it is very easy to get climate action wrong. President Macron’s combination of tax cuts for the wealthy, along with fuel duty rises which have disproportionately effect those on lower incomes, has provoked a strong reaction across France. As a result, climate action is wrongly tainted as being unfair and reducing the social and economic well-being of the majority, while the one percent can afford to carry on polluting.\n",
      "Instead, climate justice and social justice need to go hand and hand. That is why we need inclusive and just climate action that delivers for all citizens in every part of the globe. Without urgent action, continued progress will become incredibly challenging. In this sense, action on climate change is development.\n",
      "Citizens are increasingly demanding action and changing their own lifestyles. Mayors can take heart from this and engage with communities to drive bigger changes. The Global Climate Action Summit in San Francisco this year showed the huge latent potential for regional government, business and cities to work together, whatever their respective national governments’ levels of ambition.\n",
      "Therefore, 1.5°C is likely to become the most important number in human history.\n",
      "It is already the target adopted by C40, since 2016, as the level of ambition needed to be part of our network. I am looking forward to working with C40 mayors and all our partners in 2019 to redouble our efforts to make this transformation a reality.\n"

      "There is no one correct set of actions for achieving your city’s climate change goals. The actions in your plan need to be underpinned by high ambition. They should have in-built flexibility to allow the city to learn from successes and failures and to adapt the approach over time. Actions include any policy, project, programme, strategy, partnership, investment or infrastructure that leads to emission reduction and climate resilience. They can be at any size, scale or stage of implementation, from concept to implementation and monitoring. Identify and give structure to a ‘longlist’ of actions. These actions should present a clear, coherent and robust approach to meeting your city’s climate change vision, goals and targets. There are multiple, feasible and effective options to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to human-caused climate change. Cities can use the Climate Action Planning Guide to develop effective climate action plans. Taking right action now could result in the transformational change essential for a sustainable, equitable world. Global surface temperature reached 1.1°C above 1850-1900 in 2011-2020. Global greenhouse gas emissions have continued to increase. Unfair contributions arising from unsustainable energy use, land use and land-use change, lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production. Human-caused climate change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes. Vulnerable communities who have historically contributed the least to current climate change are disproportionately affected. Aim to strike a balance between collecting sufficient information and having enough indicators. Identify and propose unfunded measures and those that require legislation in the budget template. The template should also collect information about measures that departments would like to implement, but which are not yet funded. Many cities lack funding for climate action and must make hard choices. A compiled list of all proposals will allow a selection that delivers on strategic priorities. It will also be a transparent process, where decision-makers are aware of which proposals are unfunded. The final step in the process of developing a climate plan is writing it. This outlines best practices for designing, writing and launching a CAP. To stay below 1.5°C, we can expect the level of investment to be orders of magnitude greater than previously thought. The sobering conclusion of the Summary for Urban Policymakers is that we need to pursue aggressive strategies to limit global heating to 1.5°C. We need to prepare our towns, cities for the climate impacts that are already happening. Without urgent action, continued progress will become incredibly cha Citizens are increasingly demanding action and changing their own lifestyles. Mayors can take heart from this and engage with communities to drive bigger changes. The Global Climate Action Summit in San Francisco this year showed the huge latent potential for regional government, business and cities to work together.\n"

      "A city’s climate action plan (CAP) is a set of actions that have been selected, prioritised and defined to ensure that the vision, goals and targets of the plan can be achieved. A climate action is any activity your city commits to implementing to achieve its vision and strategies for adapting to climate change and reducing emissions. a climate action is any activity your city commits to implementing to achieve its vision and strategies for adapting to climate change and reducing emissions. A city’s climate action plan (CAP) should include actions that strengthen or facilitate other aspects of a CAP, for example, by building capacity, demonstrating leadership, strengthening the evidence base, enhancing governance or seeking finance. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has warned that the world is heading towards dangerous levels of climate change and that urgent action is needed to limit the rise in global temperatures to less than 2C above pre-industrial levels. The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has released its latest assessment of the state of global climate change and its drivers, with a view to acting to limit the rise in global temperatures to less than 2C above pre-industrial levels. What is climate change and what should the city do to prepare for, and respond to, climate change and the impacts it is likely to have on the people and nature of the city and its surroundings? Here are some tips on how to create a budget template that your department can use to identify and propose unfunded measures and those that require legislation in the budget template, as well as collect information about measures that departments would like to implement, but which are not yet funded. As cities prepare their climate budgets, they need to know which measures are unfunded and which are required by their local and national governments, as well as by the international community as part of the Paris Agreement. How to write a climate action plan (CAP) and how to monitor, evaluate and report on the actions taken by the city to meet its targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, as set out in the Paris Agreement. The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has published its latest assessment of the current state of global climate change and has called for urgent action to limit global warming to 1.5C. As I prepare to chair the C40 mayors’ group in 2019, here are my top three things to consider when writing my climate action plan, which will be adopted at the C40 summit in Katowice, Poland, in December.\n"
